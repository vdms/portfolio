    <p>Hi! I am Vicente Sarmento (Vince), a <strong>14-year experienced designer</strong> bridging the gap between users' interests and company objectives working as a <strong>Product Designer</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>I have worked on long-term established products and new ones</strong>, bringing them to life from the ground up - helping in each step of the product life cycle.</p>
    <p><strong>I have led product redesign and worked should-to-shoulder with Product Owners</strong> to keep the product's communication, information, and direction clear to all involved: sales, marketing, content creators, developers, and other designers.</p>
    <p>Working remotely at Semente Educação has been a blast - already three years and counting! The focus is on creating a delicious and engaging <strong>online learning experience for more than 20.000 students</strong> through three fully responsive web apps: Plataforma S, Coreskills, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.programasemente.com.br" target="_blank">Programa Semente</a>.</p>
